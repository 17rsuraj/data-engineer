#### Datasets:

Two separate datasets song_data and log_data are used in this project.

1. song_data :

This is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/) . Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song.

This is the example of single song file in this dataset,

> {"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

2. log_data :

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [Event Simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in song_data above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.
